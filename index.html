        <div id="AboutmeContainer">
            <p>Ernesto Hernandez is a California native, born in San Jose and raised in the Central Valley. He currently attends San Francisco State University, where he studies visual communication design. Passionate about photography, Ernesto enjoys capturing images primarily on 110 film, the smallest film format available. While many dismiss 110 for its low resolution and limited detail, he appreciates the unique quality and grain that this compact format offers. He also works with 35mm film.

            An outdoor enthusiast, Ernesto spends much of his time hiking, tide pooling, and camping, always seeking new adventures in nature. His creative spirit drives his interest in various design disciplines. Music serves as a major source of inspiration for him, fueling his creativity and influencing his artistic direction.

            He is also deeply inspired by Mesoamerican art and culture, recognizing how art and the natural world played a pivotal role in the civilizations of ancient Mesoamerica. This influence is evident in their architecture, pottery, fashion, and written languages, which resonate in Ernesto's work and artistic vision.</p>
